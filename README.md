# 50_FIN-Assinment

For this assignment, I created a React app that shows a list of users and lets users add new ones. I got the user data from a public API called JSONPlaceholder and kept track of it in the app's "state".

I started by making a component for the user list that gets the data from the API and displays it. Then I made a form component where users can add new users. I used "hooks" to manage the app's state and update the list when new users are added.

One challenge I faced was dealing with something called "asynchronous" API calls. But I figured out how to work around it by using some new code.

To get the user data from the API, I used a library called Axios to make requests. The app has two main components: the user list and the form. The user list shows the user data and the form lets people add new users by entering their name, email, and phone number.

For the design, I used a library called Tailwind Css to make custom styles for the components. I also used a special type of CSS called CSS Grid to make the list look good on different screen sizes.

As a bonus feature, I added a search bar that lets users filter the list by name or email address.
